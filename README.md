# Shinden Mobile

Hobby project that allows users to watch content from shinden.pl in mobile app.

App was made for my own purposes.
This project is far from perfect, but it should be usable.

## Status => W.I.P

App was made in mind of smartphone devices. 

Even though most functions **should** work, I don't guarantee they **will** work properly on your device.

## Description

Flutter shows webview with shinden webpage, injects css and js files to change how page looks and add / fix some functionalities. 

App allows you to watch videos from multiple providers (in highest available quality) in external video players.

## What's inside

- Pure Dark Mode
- Heavily slimmed down UI
- Lot's of UI changes / fixes
- AdBlock
- New Watch List
- App Link - open shinden link in app rather than in browser (enable in system settings first!)
- Stream to external video player (Next Player, VLC, MX Player etc) or download videos
    - app handles some popular video providers
    - more to come (maybe)
