# Shinden Mobile

Hobby project that allows users to watch content from shinden.pl in mobile app.

App was made for my own purposes.

## Status => W.I.P

App was made in mind of smartphone devices. 

Even though most functions **should** work, I don't guarantee they **will** work properly on your device.

## Description

Flutter shows webview with shinden webpage, injects css and js files to change how page looks and add / fix some functionalities. 

App allows users to watch videos from multiple providers (in highest available quality) in external video players.

## What's inside

- Pure Dark Mode
- Heavily slimmed down UI
- Lot's of UI changes / fixes
- AdBlock
- New Watch List
- Open shinden link in app rather than using browser (use share button and select shinden app)
- Stream to external video player (Next Player, VLC, MX Player etc) or download videos
    - app handles some popular video providers
    - more to come (maybe)
